The data for the training and testing can be found in thie following link:

This data is now divided into two parts ie, test and train based on the names of images.The images containing the word "script" in them ar part of train data,while the rest of the images are part of test data.

This can be done by using the data separator.ipynb file.This also extracts face from the data.

After the data is separated, it is uploaded to google drive, which makes it easier to access while working on Google Colab.

Upload the attendance management.ipyb to your google colab

In the ipynb, the first cell intializes your colab with your Google drive.Just execute the cell and go to the link down below, copyy the success code and then press enter.
This connects your google drive with the notebook.

Before excecuting the code, make sure the runtime type is set to cuda.

If you dont want the hassle to run and train the program, you can directly download the model and start predicting using this link:
